## 🚀 Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), a popular toolchain for building scalable React applications with zero configuration. Below are the steps and scripts you'll need to get started.

---

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (version 14.x or later) - [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (comes bundled with Node.js) or **Yarn** as the package manager.

---

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SwanandD121/FeatherPerfect_fe.git
cd FeatherPerfect_fe
npm install
```
Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run several predefined scripts to manage the development and production environment.

`1. npm start`
Starts the development server:

Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the application.
Hot-reloading: The page automatically reloads when you make changes to the code.
Displays lint errors in the console for easier debugging.
To run:

```bash
npm start
```
`2. npm test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode:

Allows you to run unit tests, ensuring your components and functions behave as expected.
Based on Jest testing framework, with built-in support for running assertions, snapshots, and mocks.
For more details, see running tests.
To run:

```bash
npm test
```
`3. npm run build`
Creates an optimized production build of the app:

Bundles the React app into static files for deployment in the build folder.
Optimizes the React code for best performance by minifying the JavaScript files.
Generates hashed filenames for caching purposes, ensuring faster load times for users.
Your app will be ready for deployment after running this command. For more information, see the deployment guide.

To build the app:

```bash
npm run build
```
`4. npm run eject`
Warning: Ejecting is a one-way operation and cannot be undone.

The eject command is meant for developers who need full control over the project's configuration:

Removes the single build dependency from your project.
Copies all Webpack, Babel, ESLint, and other configuration files into your project for direct editing.
Use this option if the default setup provided by Create React App doesn't meet your needs, but note that it introduces more complexity.
To eject:

```bash
npm run eject
```
Note: You don’t need to eject if you’re satisfied with the existing setup. Most applications are perfectly served by the built-in configuration provided by Create React App.
